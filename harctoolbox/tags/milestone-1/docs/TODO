Very low priority
ISO-8859-1 streams from dbox erroneously read.
XML export of protocol codes (not really useful).
GC GUI: Blink, relay status and manipulation (questionable usability, NR better)
support <img> elements in home and devices. (do if/when I need it)
Ping all in Home/Macros. (can be done in a macro)
EZControl udp support	 (no advantages wrt web_api)
USB-Uirt direct support	(can be done indirectly with LIRC)
TIRA direct support	(can be done indirectly with LIRC)
cntrl-c-handling (readline) - much better, still not perfect.
GUI cannot call commands with more than one argument.

Rejected - Probably never
IRTrans Gui: getremotes?, getversion?
HAL irtransmitter
Macro arguments
IRTrans tcp support (using libIRTrans.so/IRTrans.dll). (Only for learning native methods :-)

Open:
