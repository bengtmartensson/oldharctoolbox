Personal:
Set up LIRC server delta
set up harc listener

BUGS:
br2rmdu maps commandno to hex identically (without considering obc -> hex function)

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
consider ifattribute in device files
expand expected_response wrt arguments and newlines.

EXTENSIONS:
LIRC: revive/publish CCF-patch, CCF-exporter. dBox.
Eventghost: ...
JP1: RemoteMaster, extender, MkJP1, ...
Pronto-NG: ?
superremote (java/xml) (Nokia N810)
lua/netremote

Restructuring:
Rename home -> house?
home.java restructure transmit_command.
all xml: parse once and read in

BUGS, necessary features:

properites issues DONE
Generate irdb-file for components using IRTrans as gateway. (Ok, but reject)
Generate lirc.conf-file for lirc servers. DONE
console showing last line DONE
LIRC server?

Export device formats
lirc.conf	DONE
rem		DONE
rmdu		primitive version ok, TODO: integrate with RemoteMaster.
ccf		DONE
xml		DONE

ired touch	can't get "sharing your remotes" to work
pronto-ng?

Import formats
ccf		DONE (gui integration 2bdone)

Very low priority
EZControl udp support manual switches
ISO-8859-1 streams from dbox erroneously read.
GC GUI: Blink, relay status and manipulation (questionable usability, NR better)
USB-Uirt direct support	(can be done indirectly with LIRC)
TIRA direct support	(can be done indirectly with LIRC)
cntrl-c-handling (readline) - much better, still not perfect.

Rejected - Probably never
support <img> elements in home and devices. (do if/when I need it)
GUI cannot call commands with more than one argument.
IRTrans Gui: getremotes?, getversion?
HAL irtransmitter
Macro arguments
IRTrans tcp support (using libIRTrans.so/IRTrans.dll). (Only for learning native methods :-)

Open:
Browser support: XUL?, Java applet?, Javascript?, AJAX?, iPod Touch?

REJECTED:
Lua
Guile
Generate t10-irdb-fragment for t10 actions
Getline, editline support
server (listen @port -> Main.main()) (Port EG instead)
decodeIR port to Java.
IRWidget prog port.

Devices, very low priority:

Pioneer DVD (combination protocol?)
Windows media center signals
dbox keyboard -- DONE


DONE:
Ping all in Home/Macros. (can be done in a macro)
EZControl udp support	 (no advantages wrt web_api)
XML export of protocol codes (not really useful).
socketlistener (preliminary version finished)
Tonto: finished
Python
