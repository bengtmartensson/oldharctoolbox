Marrying T10, IRTrans and a JP1-remote

Generate t10dummy.rem (from devices/ezcontrol_t10.xml). Flash it into
the IRTrans irdb. To configure the actions in IRTrans:

Open the "device data base" in the IRTrans GUI client (windows
only). Open the remote named t10dummy. To configure one command, right
click that command. In panel "Default action", select "preconfigured
switch", enter the IP number of the T10, enter the switch number (1 --
32) and as value "1" for on and "0" for off. At least when using the
Ethernet/IRDG IRTrans, the other settings are ignored. Do this for all
64 commands, or the ones that are pertinent for the present
setup. Save it in a file.

Or use the supplied t10dummy.irdb ...

JP1: do an RMDU-export from ezcontrol_t10...
